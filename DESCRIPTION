Title: R implementation of Information measures
Version: 1.9.0
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Chu", family = "Pan", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "chu.pan@hnu.edu.cn"))
Description: This package compiles most of the information measures currently available: mutual information, conditional mutual information, 
    interaction information, partial information decomposition and part mutual information. All of these estimators can be used to quantify nonlinear 
    dependence between variables in (biological regulatory) network inference. The first estimator is used to infer bivariate networks while the last 
    four estimators are dedicated to analysis of trivariate networks. 
Depends: R (>= 4.0)
