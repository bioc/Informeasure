Title: R implementation of Information measures
Version: 0.99.8
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Chu", family = "Pan", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "chu.pan@hnu.edu.cn"))
Description: This package compiles most information measures currently available: mutual information, conditional mutual information, interaction information, 
    partial information decomposition and part mutual information. Using gene expression profile data, all these estimators can be employed to quantify nonlinear 
    dependence between variables in biological regulatory network inference. The first estimator is used to infer bivariate network while the last four estimators  
    are dedicated to analyze trivariate networks.
