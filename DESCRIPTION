Description: This package compiles most information measures currently available: mutual information, conditional mutual information, interaction information, 
    partial information decomposition and part mutual information. Using gene expression profile data, all these estimators can be employed to quantify the nonlinear 
    dependence between variables in biological regulatory network inference. In detail the first estimator is used to infer bivariate network while the estimation of 
    the last four are dedicated to the identification of trivariate network.
